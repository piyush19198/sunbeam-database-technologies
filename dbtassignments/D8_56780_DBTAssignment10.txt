1. Write a SQL statement to rename the table EMP to EMPLOYEE

alter table emp rename to employee;

2. Write a SQL statement to add a column region to the table DEPT

alter table dept add region char(20);

3. Write a SQL statement to add a dummy_ID as the first column of the table DUMMY

alter table dept add dummy_ID int first;

4. Write a SQL statement to change the data type of the column sal to float in the table
EMP.

alter table employee modify sal float;

5. Write a SQL statement to drop the column region from the table DEPT.

alter table dept drop region;


1. Write a procedure that computes the perimeter and the area of a rectangle. Define
your own values for the length and width. (Assuming that L and W are the length
and width of the rectangle, Perimeter = 2*(L+W) and Area = L*W.

drop procedure if exists rect;
delimiter $$
create procedure rect(l_rect int,b_rect int)
begin
	declare area_rect int;
	declare peri_rect int;
	select l_rect * b_rect into area_rect;
	select 2*(l_rect + b_rect) into peri_rect;
	insert into result values(area_rect,peri_rect);
end;
$$
delimiter ;

2. Write a procedure that declares an integer variable called num, assigns a value to it,
and computes and inserts into the temp table the value of the variable itself, its
square, and its cube.

drop procedure if exists sqcube;
delimiter $$
create procedure sqcube(num int)
begin
	declare sq int;
	declare cub int;
	select num*num into sq;
	select num*num*num into cub;
	insert into temp values(num,'NUMBER');
	insert into temp values(sq,'SQUARE');
	insert into temp values(cub,'CUBE');
end
$$
delimiter ;

3. Create a procedure to Convert a temperature in Fahrenheit (F) to its equivalent in
Celsius (C) and vice versa. The required formulae are:- C= (F-32)*5/9 F= 9/5*C +
32

drop procedure if exists temper;
delimiter $$
create procedure temper(temp double)
begin
	declare cel double;
	declare far double;
	select (temp-32)*5/9 into cel;
	select 9/5*temp+32 into far;
	insert into temp values(cel,"FahrenheitToCelsius");
	insert into temp values(far,"CelsiusToFahrenheit");
end
$$
delimiter ;

4. Create a procedure to Convert a number of inches into yards, feet, and inches. For
example, 124 inches equals 3 yards, 1 foot, and 4 inches.

drop procedure if exists conv;
delimiter $$
create procedure conv(num int)
begin
	declare y int;
	declare f int;
	declare i int;
	declare b int;
	
	set y=num/36;
	set b=num%36;
	set f=b/12;
	set i=num%12;
	
	select y,f,i;
end
$$
delimiter ;

5. Create a procedure that takes department ID and changes the manager ID for the
department to the employee in the department with lowest salary

drop procedure if exists mgrconv;
delimiter $$
create procedure mgrconv()
begin
	select
end
$$
delimiter ;
